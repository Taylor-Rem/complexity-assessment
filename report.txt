the insert function appears to be Quadratic or O(n^2) because the response time of the function increases exponentially. 
This is because the .shift() method is used which moves every value in the array every time the function is run. This means 
the time it takes to add values to the array on each iteration increases because each iteration has more values to shift.
The append function on the other hand is Linear or O(n) because the push method is used to add the multiplied value
to the end of the array, so no matter how big the given array is, each iteration of the function will take the same amount of time.
Therefore, the append function scales better.
